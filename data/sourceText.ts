1 금연정책의 배경 및 필요성
1) 흡연 현황
오늘날 전 세계적으로 약 10억 명이 흡연을 하고 있음. 그 중 80%는 매일 흡연자이며, 
성인 남성의 31%, 여성의 8%가 흡연자임. 흡연자들은 연간 약 6조 개피의 담배를 소비
하고 있는 것으로 추산 됨. 지난 30년 동안 남성 흡연율은 국가 간 편차가 있지만 약 
10% 감소했는데, 중저소득 국가보다 고소득 국가에서 감소폭이 더 크게 나타났음.1)
1980년 이후로 흡연율은 점차 감소하는 추세이나 흡연인구와 담배소비량은 증가해 왔
음.2) 세계보건기구는 담배규제기본협약(FCTC)을 통해 2010년을 기준으로 2025년까
지 15세 이상 흡연율의 30% 상대적 감소를 주요한 목표로 설정하였음3)
우리나라 성인남성의 현재 흡연율은 1998년 66.3%, 2001년 60.9%에서 담배가격 
인상(2004년･2015년), 금연구역 지정 및 확대, 금연 캠페인･홍보 등 강화된 금연정책 
시행에 따른 금연 규범의 확산으로 2022년 남자 흡연율 30.0%, 여자 흡연율 5.0%로 
2021년에 비해 남자는 1.3%p, 여자는 1.9%p 감소하여 1998년 이후 가장 낮은 수치
